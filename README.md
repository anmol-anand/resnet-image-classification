# Fast image classification using ResNet variant

In this project, I have created an advanced image classification model that harnesses the potential of ResNet in conjunction with shortcut networks, achieving exceptional precision and efficiency during training. The introduction of a novel ResNet variant, carefully optimized in terms of layer depth, channel sizes, and skip connections, strikes an ideal balance between complexity and performance. The model showcased remarkable results, attaining an impressive accuracy of 93.56% within just 90 epochs over the CIFAR-10 dataset, a testament to its strategic approach in overcoming challenges like vanishing gradients and slow convergence.
